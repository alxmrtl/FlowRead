# DEV NOTES PARSER PROMPT

## Role
Act as a senior software engineer and prompt editor. Optimize my raw notes for execution by a programming LLM. Maintain the original language.

## Inputs
<text>{selection}</text>

Optional context: <constraints>, <repo or tech stack clues>, <priority>, <acceptance criteria> if present in notes.

## Part A — Text Editing Pass
Correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
Improve readability and flow while preserving meaning, terminology, and original language.
Reformat into clear, reasonably sized paragraphs suitable for LLM consumption.
Output Section 1 only with the edited text and nothing else. No explanations, no introductions, no commentary, no quotes before or after.
Label this section exactly: SECTION 1 — EDITED TEXT

## Part B — Hierarchical Planning Pass
Extract the top-level goal from the notes.
Decompose into subgoals and components using a strict hierarchy: Goal -> Components -> Tasks.
For each component: define scope, surface assumptions, list risks, and identify metrics of success.
Produce a dependency graph and priority order.
Label this section exactly: SECTION 2 — HIERARCHICAL PLAN

## Part C — Problem Analysis and Root Causes
Convert pain points from the notes into a structured, prioritized to-do list.
For each to-do item: identify plausible root causes, observations or evidence from the notes, and quick probes to validate.
Label this section exactly: SECTION 3 — TO-DO WITH ROOT CAUSES

## Part D — Solution Design Options
For each to-do item: offer 1 to 3 solution options that are clean and elegant. Optimize for efficiency, readability, maintainability, and scalability.
Include tradeoffs, complexity level, and expected impact on performance and reliability.
State preferred option with a one-line rationale.
Label this section exactly: SECTION 4 — SOLUTION OPTIONS

## Part E — Implementation Plan
Provide a step-by-step plan with numbered steps, each step mapped to files or modules when inferable from notes.
Include data migrations or config changes if relevant.
Add rollback strategy and checkpoints.
Label this section exactly: SECTION 5 — IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## Part F — Code Quality Gates
Enforce modern best practices: clear naming, pure functions where reasonable, small modules, defensive error handling, input validation, minimal surface area, immutability where it reduces bugs, safe concurrency, efficient I O, and clear boundaries.
Performance: state expected complexity of hot paths, memory considerations, and any caching or streaming decisions.
Security and reliability: sanitize inputs, avoid unsafe eval or deserialization, handle timeouts and retries where applicable, and log with structured context.
Label this section exactly: SECTION 6 — QUALITY GATES

## Part G — Tests and Verification
Provide minimal yet sufficient tests: unit tests for core logic, edge cases, property based tests if suitable, and a tiny integration test that exercises the main flow.
Include acceptance criteria that map back to the to-do list.
Provide a quick manual QA checklist.
Label this section exactly: SECTION 7 — TESTS

## Part H — Deliverables
Revised code or representative snippets with clear code fences.
Diff or patch style changes when possible.
Updated documentation, changelog entry, and run instructions.
Label this section exactly: SECTION 8 — DELIVERABLES

## Part I — Clarifications Only If Blocking
Do not assume missing details. If any detail blocks safe or correct implementation, ask concise clarifying questions in a single list. If nothing blocks, omit this section.
Label this section exactly: SECTION 9 — CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED

## Hybrid JSON Prompting Rule
If you judge that a structured schema would increase accuracy, precede the prose sections with a JSON block named PLAN that mirrors Sections 2 to 7 with fields: objective, components[], to_do[], dependencies[], risks[], metrics[], steps[], tests[], acceptance_criteria[], rollback[], open_questions[]. Keep keys snake_case. Keep values concise. Then follow with the prose sections as specified. If JSON would not increase accuracy, omit it.

## Self Check and Variant Probe
Internally generate up to 4 lightweight plan variants for Sections 2 to 5, select the best based on clarity, risk, and expected impact, and proceed with only the selected plan. Provide a short rationale in one paragraph at the top of Section 5 explaining the selection. Do not output the discarded variants.

## Completion Contract
Leave the codebase better: simpler, faster, cleaner, working.
No hallucinated APIs or files. If uncertain and not blocking, mark assumptions explicitly.

Outputs must follow the exact section labels and order:
- SECTION 1 — EDITED TEXT
- SECTION 2 — HIERARCHICAL PLAN
- SECTION 3 — TO-DO WITH ROOT CAUSES
- SECTION 4 — SOLUTION OPTIONS
- SECTION 5 — IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
- SECTION 6 — QUALITY GATES
- SECTION 7 — TESTS
- SECTION 8 — DELIVERABLES
- SECTION 9 — CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED
